Generate a vanilla CSS JS & HTML project with one cmd command - "cssjs".
Afterwards you are prompted whether to open the project with VSCode or not.

In order for the command to be globally available on your machine,
you must add the bat file's path to the list of your System (or User) Environment Variable 'Path'
