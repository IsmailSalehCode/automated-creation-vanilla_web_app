## Overview

Generate a vanilla CSS JS & HTML project with one cmd command - "cssjs".
Afterwards you are prompted whether to open the project with VSCode or not.

In order for the command to be globally available on your machine,
you must add the bat file's path to the list of your User Environment Variable 'Path'.

## Purpose
As a front-end developer, I often find myself needing to whip up a quick light-weight vanilla web project in order to practice and/or brush up on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.
